# hubot-github-issue-label-notifier
[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]

A Hubot plugin for alerts in your chat for GitHub issue labels.

## Basic setup

- `npm install hubot-github-issue-label-notifier --save`
- Add the script to your Hubot using **external-scripts.json**.
- Set the `HUBOT_GITHUB_NOTIFIER_SECRET` environment variable to a secret key. Choose something secure!
- Optionally: Set a `HUBOT_GITHUB_NOTIFIER_LABEL_FILTER` environment variable with a filter for issues. Without a filter, all labels are used. Multiple values are comma separated.

## GitHub webhook setup

You'll want to setup a GitHub webhook to point to this script. Here's the basics:

- Payload URL: http://example.com/hubot/github-issue-label/specific-chat-room *(update `example.com` and `specific-chat-room` for your environment)*.
- Choose `application/json` as the **Content type**.
- You'll need to specify the same **secret** as your `HUBOT_GITHUB_NOTIFIER_SECRET` environment variable.
- Make sure it's not set to **push** events only -- **everything** or **Issues** are sufficient.

GitHub enables you to replay **Recent Deliveries** using a web browser, which can be handy if you're debugging.
